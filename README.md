## ✨ Features

### 🎥 Video Recording
Record video clips for every ball and automatically tag them with match metadata — player name, ball type, runs scored, and ball number. All videos are stored locally in IndexedDB and can be exported or synced to the backend when connectivity is restored.

### 📊 Live Scoring
Track innings, overs, runs, wickets, and ball-by-ball outcomes in real time across a full match lifecycle — from toss to match summary.

### 📴 Offline-First
CreaseCam works fully offline. All match data, videos, and player photos are stored on-device and sync automatically when you reconnect.

### 📲 Install to Home Screen
Add CreaseCam to your home screen on any device for a native app experience — no app store required.

### 🔔 Notifications
Get notified when videos are saved, sync completes, or the app needs your attention — all through the browser's native notification system.

### ☁️ Cloud Sync
Match data syncs seamlessly to **Supabase** in the background. Videos can be uploaded to your backend API endpoint when online.

## 📦 Storage Architecture

CreaseCam uses a layered storage system to ensure no data is ever lost.

### IndexedDB — `cricketMediaDB`

| Store | Key Fields |
|---|---|
| `videos` | `id`, `blob`, `ballNumber`, `playerName`, `ballType`, `runs` |
| `images` | `id`, `blob`, `playerName`, `captureTime` |
| `recordings` | `id` (auto), `blob`, `metadata` |

### LocalStorage

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `team1` / `team2` | Team rosters and data |
| `overs` | Match overs configuration |
| `inning` | Current inning state |
| `pwa_video_log` | Video metadata log |
| `match_videos` | Video ID references |

### Cache Storage

| Cache | Strategy |
|---|---|
| `STATIC_CACHE` | HTML, CSS, JS — stale-while-revalidate |
| `DYNAMIC_CACHE` | Runtime resources |
| `OFFLINE_CACHE` | Fallback pages for offline use |

---

## ⚙️ PWA Utilities

### `PWAUtils`
The core utility object, initialized on every page.

```javascript
PWAUtils.init()                          // Boot PWA
PWAUtils.installPWA()                    // Trigger install prompt
PWAUtils.isConnected()                   // Check online status
PWAUtils.showNotification(title, opts)   // Send a notification
PWAUtils.getStorageQuota()               // Check storage usage
PWAUtils.exportAllData()                 // Backup all data
PWAUtils.importData(file)                // Restore from backup
PWAUtils.MediaDB.saveVideo(blob, meta)   // Store a video blob
PWAUtils.MediaDB.getAllVideos()          // Retrieve all videos
```

### `PWAVideoHelpers`
Dedicated helpers for the video recording workflow in `match.html`.

```javascript
PWAVideoHelpers.saveRecordedVideo(blob, metadata)
PWAVideoHelpers.getVideoURL(videoId)
PWAVideoHelpers.getAllMatchVideos()
PWAVideoHelpers.getVideoStorageStats()
PWAVideoHelpers.exportAllVideos(filename)
PWAVideoHelpers.syncVideosToServer(apiEndpoint, onProgress)
PWAVideoHelpers.createVideoPreviewCard(video)
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone and serve
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/creasecam.git
cd creasecam

# Serve locally (PWA requires a server context)
npx serve .
```

> ⚠️ PWA features (service workers, install prompts) require **HTTPS** in production. `localhost` is the only exception.

### 2. Configure Supabase
In `index.html`, initialize your Supabase client with your project URL and anon key:

```javascript
const supabase = createClient('YOUR_SUPABASE_URL', 'YOUR_ANON_KEY')
```

### 3. (Optional) Set up video upload endpoint
Create a backend endpoint at `/api/upload-video` that accepts a `POST` request with `FormData` containing the video blob and metadata. Returns `200 OK` on success.

### 4. Deploy with HTTPS
Deploy to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages) to enable the full PWA experience including installability and background sync.

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging

Open your browser's DevTools console and run:

```javascript
// Check app info and PWA status
await PWAUtils.getAppInfo()

// Check video storage
await PWAVideoHelpers.getVideoStorageStats()

// Check device storage quota
await PWAUtils.getStorageQuota()
```

To test offline mode: **DevTools → Network tab → set to "Offline"**, then navigate through the app.
